something what i know but i do not know
second commit i know it is not good but not bad 
third one, it is not end
and forth one, i don't know what i need to do
last commit and that is end 


Cinnamon in my teeth
From your kiss
You're touching me
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me
At arm's length don't work
You try to push me out
But I just find my way back in
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me out
I win

There's things I wanna say to you
But I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about
But better not to give
